#MP3 Coloring

This is a short piece of code intended to examine a large directory of MP3s that has been subdivided into folders containing various (often messy) subdivisions of the collection.  The program highlights MP3s whose bit rate is 128 kbps or less, as well as the folders that they're in.


The code is intended to be executed from a bash terminal.  As this code uses the <TT>osascript</TT> command (which passes commands from the bash terminal to AppleScript), it can only be successfully used on a Mac.
